Part 2:

  

_Discussion: What would be a really simple solution if n were not an argument, i.e. if it were always 17?_

  

**Due to the fact that we would not have to set up any loops to do the calculations, and that we know the exact number then we can go straight ahead to printing the output. The program would be very simple at that point because we will not have to test the users input. We would not need the try and catch at all, and we would not need to test to see if the user has put in a positive integer or not since we know early what the number we are testing is. This program would be fairly simple and small. Because we know when to print fizz, buzz, or fizz buzz, and we know what numbers that are divisible by what in order to obtain those string results, then we can write code to output exactly 17 times and just adjust the divisibility aspect of the calculations.**

  

Part 3:

  

_Discussion: How could you have automatically tested your initial solution from part 2?_

  

**There could be a few different ways but essentially you would have to take the user input and set its value to a variable and then initialize that within a loop in order to test the result. This would be far more annoying than creating a test class. If you do not want to use the user input, then you would have to specify specifically the argument/number you will test. For instance, not use a variable but rather a specific integer or integers and then print results through output stream.  Knowing your solution exactly before hand will make writing the code to test that specific number really easy, and then it would be just a matter of printing the results.**

  

Part 4:

  

_Discussion: What changes between parts 2,3, and 4? And what stays the same? Does it matter what list implantation you choose? If so, in what way?_

  

**Part 2 is very different from 3 and 4. Part 2 is simply establishing the fizz buzz program logic, but we only work in one class, without testing. The major difference is we are printing from the output stream, while in parts 3 and 4 we are generating from an array or list. We also add different methods and classes to 3 and 4 in comparison to 2. We create a different class where we put in the array or list, called FizzBuzz and then we add a test class for this FizzBuzz class in order to test our results. In parts 3 and 4, we invoke everything and run it via the Main class, where we also see the users input to see if we can proceed with the program. It does not really matter what list implantation you choose, as long as the test methods are passing. In parts 3 and 4 in our test classes we actually test certain integers whereas in part 2 we are not testing certain integer values.**

**I would prefer a list over an array because it is more flexible on the users input in terms of memory.**
